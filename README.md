# Hi, I'm Matthew!

I'm currently a second-year computer science student at Northeastern University.

## My interests

- Cybersecurity: CTFs, blue-teaming, reverse engineering, finding vulnerabilities
- Self-hosting and systems administration with Linux servers
- Infrastructure-as-code and automation tools: Terraform/OpenTofu, Ansible
- Containerization tools: Docker, Docker Compose
- General software development (unsurprisingly)
- Computer hardware and PC building

I'm drawn towards DevOps because it combines a lot of my interests together - but I'm open to many roles that match my interests :)
